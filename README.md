# drawio diagrams repo

This Repo serves as a collection of images and diagrams to visualise different technology concepts using drawio.

Main goal of this repo ist to collect images that are a good simplification of technologies such as containers, docker, k8s etc.
These Diagrams can then be used for presentations that aim to explain these technologies to beginners.

## Contributing 

Feel free to use any of the images for your own presentations

Also Contributions are welcome:
if you have a good idea for a visualisation of a technology, a component or basic concept, feel free to add it as a drawio diagram into this repo.
Diagrams could be anything that help explaining the technology itself or the motivation behind it.

Helpful diagrams could be visualsing:
- Containers in general
- Containers in the real world
- The layers idea of containers
- use of Containers in a devops scenario

- K8s architecture and components:
  - Kinds of Nodes
  - Components of each type of node (etcd, kubelet, kubeproxy...)
  - Controllers
  - Pods, Replicasets, Deployments..
  - Multicontainer Pods: Sidecar, Ambessador, Adapter...
  - Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
  - Ingress
  
Also any selfdrawn(!!) icons for Technologies are useful: python, java, springboot, kafka, 


So if you have landed in this repo to create PRs for hacktober:
 this repo could be an easy way to contribute while still being engaging and perhaps interesting
